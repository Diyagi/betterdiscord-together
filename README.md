Better Discord Together, the new feature which brings synced gameplay,
full source from https://github.com/9qz/powercord-together huge thanks for the idea and the source I only did the port to better discord.
Both Versions work for now!
Version 1 is for developers, testers wanting to try out new features first. The Version 2 uses the official discord menu for the games and apps and it's way more stable
